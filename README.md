# Supporting Information – Oligothiophene-based Photosensitizers with Tunable Push-Pull Architectures: Design, Synthesis and Characterization

This repository contains the Supporting Information (SI) related to the manuscript:

“Oligothiophene-based Photosensitizers with Tunable Push–Pull Architectures: Design, Synthesis and Characterization”  
S. Flammini et al., under review

## Contents

### `td-dft/spectra/`
Simulated UV-Vis spectra of the investigated photosensitizers obtained via TD-DFT using Gaussian 16.

### `td-dft/opt_S1/`
Optimized geometries of the first singlet excited state (S1) obtained via TD-DFT using Gaussian 16.

### `flow-cytometry/`
Flow cytometry experimental data files (`.fcs`), corresponding to biological characterization of the compounds.

## Notes
- All TD-DFT calculations were performed using Gaussian16 Rev. C.01.
- Flow cytometry data is provided in raw `.fcs` format for reproducibility.
- File naming corresponds to the identifiers used in the manuscript and SI.

This repository will be archived and assigned a DOI upon publication.
